# React Native + TypeScript

# Interfaces

What is the difference between: type, class, interface?

- **class:** used to create instances
- **type:** Only exist in TS
- **interface:** Only exist in TS and is most easy to expand that Type.
  - The main goal of interfaces is to tell TS what my objects look like.
  - Create validation rules to objects
